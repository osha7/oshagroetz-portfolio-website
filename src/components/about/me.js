                With a background in fashion and restaurants (? yes, IDK either!?), it was time to make a change!
                I'm starting a new life in coding and pretty nervous, but proud of myself and how much I learned in the Flatiron Software Engineer Program.
                <br />Originally hailing from New York/New Hampshire: My husband, our 4 year old ShibaInu, Yoshi, and I currently live in Denver, CO. 
                <br />I love eating, so in turn found myself having to learn to cook...and would like to create a cookbook next.
                <br />I grew up on the ocean, so I'm actively daydreaming about how to get back to the beach every second!
