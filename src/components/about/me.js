                <h2>The Dry Side:</h2>
                Proactive individual with strong skills in project management, identifying and troubleshooting critical issues and team collaboration. 
                Possesses an acute eye for graphic design & marketing with a passion for innovative tech. 
                <br/>*Experienced in React.JS and Ruby on Rails based programming with a background in business development and start-up growth.
                <br/><br/><h2>My Side:</h2>
                I'm starting a new life in coding and pretty nervous...but proud of myself and how much I have learned in the last 5 months.
                <br />With a background in fashion and restaurants (? yes, IDK either!?), it was time to make a change!<br />
                Originally hailing from New York/New Hampshire: My husband, our 4 year old ShibaInu, Yoshi, and I currently live in Denver, CO. 
                <br />I'm actively daydreaming about how to get back to the beach, every second!  Being in the ocean is my meditation.
                <br />I love eating, so in turn found myself having to learn to cook...and would like to create a cookbook next. Well, maybe after I get a job.
