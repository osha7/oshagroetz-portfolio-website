                    <br/><br/>My background ranges from being a 5 year partner in a restaurant/cafe chain in Vail & Denver, CO, as well having been formally trained in Fashion Design in NYC. While running our restaurants, I developed the company's brand, designing all of our menu boards, graphics and our wholesale packaging. I loved learning and working on the backend of the website to update menu items, locations, and press releases.
                    <br/><br/>At the start of 2020, I decided that as the world was changing, so would I. I knew this change would have to involve a career where I would get to combine design and technology. 
                    I attended Flatiron Schools unbelievable Software Engineering program in April 2020, and have recently graduated in September 2020.
                    I have strong skills in project management, identifying and troubleshooting critical issues and team collaboration. 
                    My background in business development and start-up growth will be an asset to my next role.
